### VLOOKUP	
Looks up a range and returns the first corresponding value in a vertical table that matches exactly the specified input.
### HLOOKUP	
Looks up a range and returns the first corresponding value in a horizontal table that matches exactly the specified input. An error is returned if it cannot find the exact match.
### INDEX	
Works like the coordinates of a map and returns a single value based on the column and row numbers you input into the function fields.
### MATCH	
Returns the position of a value in a column or a row. Modelers often combine MATCH with the INDEX function to create a lookup function, which is far more robust and flexible and uses less memory than the VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP.

### IPMT	
Calculates the interest component of a loan.
### PPMT	
Calculates the principal component of a loan.
### NPV
